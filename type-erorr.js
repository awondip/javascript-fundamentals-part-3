// Type Error
// These errors are thrown for a few different reasons:

// Per MDN, a TypeError may be thrown when:

// an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function;
// or when attempting to modify a value that cannot be changed;
// or when attempting to use a value in an inappropriate way.

//Example

const str1 = "Hello";
const str2 = "World!";
const message = str1.push(str2);

// Syntax Error
// A syntax error occurs when the code you are trying to run is not written correctly, i.e., in accordance with the grammatical rules of JavaScript. For example this:

function helloWorld() {
   console.log "Hello World!"
}
// will throw the following error, because we forgot the parentheses for console.log()!
